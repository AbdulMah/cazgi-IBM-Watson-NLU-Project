Install Server-side packages

    Change to the server directory.

    cd /home/project/cazgi-IBM-Watson-NLU-Project/sentimentAnalyzeServer

    All packages are needed to be installed are listed in package.json. Run npm install -s, to install and save those packages.

    npm install  -s

ðŸ’¡Click here for the checklist of required packages

    Run the server using the following command.

    npm start

    If all the required packages are successfully installed, the server should start without any issues.

    Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.

Part C: Install IBM Watson package and set up the .env file

    Install the ibm-watson package in your server side using the following command.

    npm install  -s ibm-watson@6.1.1

    Right click on the sentimentAnalyzeServer in the explorer and a new file named .env.

    Copy the credentials to point to your Watson NLU credentials from the IBM cloud, if you have not already done so in the previous lab.

    Add the credentials required to the .env file you created.

    The contents of the .env file would be as below

    API_KEY=<your api key>
    API_URL=<your url>

    Install dotenv to use the .env file in the server application using the following command.

    npm install  -s dotenv@10.0.0

    Make changes in your express JS (in the file named sentimentAnalyzerServer.js) to define and implement a method getNLUInstance() where you create an instance of NaturalLanguageUnderstanding using the credential from the .env file using dotenv package and return the instance. You can refer to this link for more details on how to do this.

    const NaturalLanguageUnderstandingV1 = require('ibm-watson/natural-language-understanding/v1');
    const { IamAuthenticator } = require('ibm-watson/auth');

    const naturalLanguageUnderstanding = new NaturalLanguageUnderstandingV1({
        version: '2021-08-01',
        authenticator: new IamAuthenticator ({
            apikey: api_key
        }),
        serviceUrl: api_url
    });
    return naturalLanguageUnderstanding;

Part D: Create end points

    Observe that the server code intends to provide 4 end-points. One of the end-points has been provided for you. Uncomment it and observe the code. It is highly recommended that you attempt to implement these end-points by yourself in sentimentAnalyzerServer.js before you use the code given below to complete the assignment.

    These are points you should keep in mind, while implementing the end-points.

    Each of the end points should use the getNLUInstance() created in the previous part to return appropriate response.
    Each end point should send a JSON or a string response as may be considered relevant.
    The JSON object returned from the IBM NaturalLanguageUnderstanding API is as in the below image. We need to extract the information that we need.

    /url/emotion end-point is used to analyze the emotion using NLU, for a given url.

    app.get("/url/emotion", (req,res) => {
        let urlToAnalyze = req.query.url
        const analyzeParams = 
        {
            "url": urlToAnalyze,
            "features": {
                "keywords": {
                    "emotion": true,
                    "limit": 1
                }
            }
        }
        
        const naturalLanguageUnderstanding = getNLUInstance();
        
        naturalLanguageUnderstanding.analyze(analyzeParams)
        .then(analysisResults => {
            //Retrieve the emotion and return it as a formatted string
            return res.send(analysisResults.result.keywords[0].emotion,null,2);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            return res.send("Could not do desired operation "+err);
        });
    });

    /url/sentiment end-point is used to analyze the sentiment using NLU, for a given url.

    app.get("/url/sentiment", (req,res) => {
        let urlToAnalyze = req.query.url
        const analyzeParams = 
        {
            "url": urlToAnalyze,
            "features": {
                "keywords": {
                    "sentiment": true,
                    "limit": 1
                }
            }
        }
        
        const naturalLanguageUnderstanding = getNLUInstance();
        
        naturalLanguageUnderstanding.analyze(analyzeParams)
        .then(analysisResults => {
            //Retrieve the sentiment and return it as a formatted string

            return res.send(analysisResults.result.keywords[0].sentiment,null,2);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            return res.send("Could not do desired operation "+err);
        });
    });

    /text/emotion end-point is used to analyze the emotion using NLU, for a given text.

    app.get("/text/emotion", (req,res) => {
        let textToAnalyze = req.query.text
        const analyzeParams = 
        {
            "text": textToAnalyze,
            "features": {
                "keywords": {
                    "emotion": true,
                    "limit": 1
                }
            }
        }
        
        const naturalLanguageUnderstanding = getNLUInstance();
        
        naturalLanguageUnderstanding.analyze(analyzeParams)
        .then(analysisResults => {
            //Retrieve the emotion and return it as a formatted string

            return res.send(analysisResults.result.keywords[0].emotion,null,2);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            return res.send("Could not do desired operation "+err);
        });
    });

    /text/sentiment end-point is used to analyze the sentiment using NLU, for a given text.

    app.get("/text/sentiment", (req,res) => {
        let textToAnalyze = req.query.text
        const analyzeParams = 
        {
            "text": textToAnalyze,
            "features": {
                "keywords": {
                    "sentiment": true,
                    "limit": 1
                }
            }
        }
        
        const naturalLanguageUnderstanding = getNLUInstance();
        
        naturalLanguageUnderstanding.analyze(analyzeParams)
        .then(analysisResults => {
            //Retrieve the sentiment and return it as a formatted string

            return res.send(analysisResults.result.keywords[0].sentiment,null,2);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            return res.send("Could not do desired operation "+err);
        });
    });

Part E - React Client Side

    Change to client directory sentimentAnalyzeClient.

    cd /home/project/cazgi-IBM-Watson-NLU-Project/sentimentAnalyzeClient
